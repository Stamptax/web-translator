## Web-Translator

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

A Firefox extension for translating web pages.

### Features

- Translate selected text on web pages to Chinese, Japanese or English.
- Select different AI models from ChatGPT or Gemini (since they are relatively cheap).
- Select different interface languages.

### Installation

1. Download the `Web-Translator.xpi` file from the release page.
2. Open Firefox and type `about:debugging` in the address bar.
3. Click on `This Firefox` and then click on `Load Temporary Add-on`.
4. Select the `Web-Translator.xpi` file.

**Note:** This is a temporary extension and only for Firefox (I am too lazy to get it certified by Mozilla since it's only used by me).

### Usage

1. Click it from the toolbar.
2. Fill in the API key of ChatGPT or Gemini.
3. Select the AI model.
4. Select the target language.
5. Select text by right clicking.
6. Hover the cursor over the popped icon.
7. The translation will be shown soon.
